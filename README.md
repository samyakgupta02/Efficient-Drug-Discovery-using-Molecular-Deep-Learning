# Efficient-Drug-Discovery-using-Molecular-Deep-Learning
This project aims to facilitate efficient drug discovery using molecular deep learning through an interactive platform developed with Streamlit. The application allows users to upload datasets, train deep learning models, and make predictions on drug viability based on molecular features. Key functionalities include:

Data Upload: Users can upload a CSV file containing molecular data (e.g., molecular weight, solubility, hydrophobicity, logP values) and save it for future use.

Model Training: A deep learning model is built using TensorFlow and trained on uploaded data. The model predicts drug toxicity based on molecular properties, with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score evaluated for performance. The trained model is saved for future use.

Prediction: Users can input molecular features to predict the viability of a drug using the trained model, which outputs whether the drug is considered viable.

A synthetic dataset is also provided for testing and demonstration purposes. The project showcases how AI can be applied to streamline drug discovery processes.
